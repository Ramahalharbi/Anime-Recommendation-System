# 🎌 Anime Recommendation System  

This project is an **AI-powered recommendation system** designed to help users discover new anime titles based on their preferences.  
It combines **Content-Based Filtering** with the **Nearest Neighbor algorithm** to generate accurate and personalized suggestions.  

✨ Because user experience matters, I built a Graphical User Interface (GUI) 🖥️ that was not part of the initial scope. I developed it as an extra enhancement to make the system more professional, visually appealing, and user-friendly — ensuring recommendations feel smooth, interactive, and engaging.

## 🖼️ GUI Overview  
The system provides a simple, interactive interface where:  
1. 🏠 Users start from a clean home screen.  
2. 🎬 They enter their preferences (anime title or genre).  
3. 📑 The system generates a ranked list of five recommended anime titles.
